# jSQL
jSQL is an implementation of the server half of Microsoft's Tabular Data Stream protocol (described [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/E/95EF66AF-9026-4BB0-A41D-A4F81802D92C/[MS-TDS].pdf "[MS-TDS]")) and Microsoft's Session Multiplex Protocol wrapper (described [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/E/95EF66AF-9026-4BB0-A41D-A4F81802D92C/[MC-SMP].pdf "[MC-SMP]")). The idea is to create a library that can be used to create entities that appear to be MS SQL servers, but can provide and insert into data sources beyond that of a normal SQL instance. This means you could create a linked server to a jSQL instance and read data from arbitary CSV files without the use of an SSIS package, update active directory like you would a normal table, read data from a table on an HTML page, read flat files, execute shell commands and read the output like a table, or even read data from CSV files on an SFTP server without having to download them to a temporary directory. The use of interfaces means it's very easy to add fake databases and tables you can query from, insert into, or update. A built-in set of data processing classes (built with inspiration from C#'s System.Data namespace and LINQ) makes it very easy to perform everything from joins to unions on any data you can adapt to the interfaces.
